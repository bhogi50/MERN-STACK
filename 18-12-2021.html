            My deepest condolences to Mr. Jobs' family and close friends. The world has lost a true visionary and innovator. His work however will remain with all of us that appreciate his designs every time we use any apple product. He will never be forgotten.

            Dearest Steve & Apple, Thank you Steve. Thank you for unlocking our imaginations. Thank you for your entrepreneurial spirit. You went beyond what a product usually does. All of what you've done, has changed the World for the better. Life is more poignant, fulfilling, and interactive. I am so Sad to hear of your passing. A bright light has dimmed for every person you touched. But I am glad your years of suffering have ended. You were an incredible man. Among the likes of Walt Disney, Thomas Edision, and Henry Ford. The integration of technology and the human spirit is Earth shattering. So every-time an I-Anything is used you will be remembered as the man that created a bridge from the ice age to a paradise of possibilities. You have changed me and my family's life. Thank you again Steve.

            <b>Honoring Steve</b><br /><br />
            Mr. Jobs was an amazing inspiration to millions of people, including myself. As an artist I marveled at the beautiful care and craft that Steve demanded from all his products. His candor and precision spoke to all of us who aspire to follow our hearts and dreams and refuse to stop creating. While he will be sincerely missed, Steve will always be present in the global community he created and his numerous innovations that changed the way we all live. Thank you Steve for not just creating beautiful tools but for helping create a beautiful new generation.

            <b>May he rest in peace</b><br /><br />
            As a high school student that is CompTIA A+ certified and an ACA OS X 10.6 integration certified technician, I was saddened today to hear of the loss of Mr. Jobs. In all of the time I have spent around technology, no company has been as influential in my opinion as Apple has. As many know, Apple's survival past the turn of the century, and subsequent major releases (i.e. iPod and iPhone) were largely attributed to the work of Mr. Jobs. I think I speak for many people when I say that he will be missed.

            <b>Timeless respect</b><br /><br />
            It is really sad to loose someone as wonderful and intelligent as mr. Steve Jobs. He was and still remains a life example to a lot of us human beings. This is a black day in history of apple and will be remembered as the day the father of technology as we know it left this world. He leaves a big responsibility to all of us and I hope we can take it and make him proud. I am sure that the people he left in charge are really capable to keep the company on that height it already is and always has been. There is nothing more to say. R.I.P. Steve Jobs you have left us a grate gift and we thank you every day. With the biggest of respects.

            After hearing of Steve's death and looking around the room, I see my imac, macbook pro, ipad, iphone and scattered attachments and boxes to all of them in my office. I realize and smile, "this man will never be forgotten". He has made my life and everyone else who loves music, education, games, design and creativity on a technological scale's life so much more enjoyable, care free and aesthetically pleasing. A true genius and creative wizard. I only wish I had one ounce the drive and determination it takes to accomplish what he has.

            Dear Apple team, Just heard... Steve Jobs was someone I always admired and dreamed to meet him in person one day.... He was someone that comes to the world of humanity once in a century.... I am so sad for this irreplaceable loss... but I am confident he will find peace wherever he is now...
